title: JavaScript Framework
---


Welcome to Project 3, which focuses on learning the modern JavaScript framework React.

Frameworks are used to make some tasks faster and easier to achieve. However they come with an extra layer of complexity. At their most basic, JS frameworks are collections of JavaScript code libraries that provide developers with pre-written JS code to use for routine programming features to build websites or web applications.

A framework though, differently from a JS library, doesnâ€™t just offer an individual solution to a coding problem, it provides a structure that organizes the parts of your site where the framework is implemented.

The most 3 popular JavaScript frameworks are Vue, React and Angular. They are structured similarly, but their syntax and internal processes are slightly different.

## Project Overview

During the first Sprint you will have time to get familiar with React by creating a small project.

From the second Sprint, you will have 3 weeks to deliver a Progressive Web Application (PWA) of your choice.

The topic will be up to you, but we will provide you with the minimum requirements of features.

Towards the end of the project you will learn about Firebase, a powerful Google platform that you will use to create a login feature and to store information in a database without the need of a Back-End!

**Completion Time**: 4 weeks
