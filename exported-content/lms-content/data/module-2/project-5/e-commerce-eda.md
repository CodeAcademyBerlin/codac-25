title: e-Commerce EDA
---


This is your third EDA, so we are confident you can do this easily. Create a report that will be presented to the management team of 'VS Group.' They would like to see how much you have understood the E-Commerce business and your data analysis.

## Epic 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

There are plenty of insights you can deduce from this dataset. As a starting point, here are some ideas which you could present to the team:

* What customer purchasing patterns can you discover? Such as activity on different days of the week, or weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc.
* Are there specific days/months/quarters when the sales have been unusually high/low, and what could be the possible reasons? How about the profit and loss margin?
* Which States and which customers made the highest number of orders? Are they the same as the highest spenders?
* Can you make a map showing the 5 States generating the most and least sales revenue?
* Can we see any patterns in the quarterly revenue behavior?
* Can you create a plot showing the growth rate of new customers over the months?
* What do you think about the customers? Are they individuals or wholesalers? Why would you say so?
* Are there any issues with the dataset?

**You don't have to create all these plots. Choose the most relevant for your analysis.**

## Epic 2: Suggest meaningful KPIs for VS Group's business

A KPI, or key performance indicator, is a quantifiable measure of performance over time for a specific objective. They are commonly written using the SMART technique:

* Specific: What exactly does the company want to achieve?
* Measurable: How will the management identify that the goal has been achieved?
* Achievable: Is the goal attainable?
* Relevant: How does it help the overall business objectives?
* Time-bound: When will the goal be delivered, and what are the key milestones along the way?

For more information on this, you can visit [this link](https://mileiq.com/blog-en-gb/smart-business-goals). Take a little bit of time to do some research into e-Commerce KPIs related to customer behavior and sales optimization.

**Considering all this information, present 2-4 KPIs that you think would add value to VS Group in their business.**

## Epic 3: Build a Tableau Dashboard

We touched on Tableau in the very first week, and a powerful way to combine visualizations is to [create an interactive dashboard](https://www.tableau.com/dashboard/what-is-dashboard). If you haven't already, have a look at Tableau's own [basics tutorials](https://public.tableau.com/app/learn/how-to-videos) (which make use of a familiar dataset), then search for some existing dashboards in Tableau Public, or online tutorials, for dashboard inspiration.

Tableau itself, and dashboard design, are huge topics you will not master by the end of this project, so feel free to use a variety of resources to help you create a unique BI dashboard you can showcase in your presentation.
