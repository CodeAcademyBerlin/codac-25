## E-Commerce

**VS Group**, a U.S. company with ambitions to expand their burgeoning E-Commerce business within the USA, faces two main challenges:

1. **Modernize their outdated database structure**: they seek to transition to a more sustainable SQL database solution to enhance operational efficiency and scalability. Your expertise and support are essential for achieving this goal.
2. **Conduct a comprehensive competitive analysis**: this endeavor aims to gather valuable insights that will inform their strategic approach and go-to market strategy.

### Competitive analysis

Competitive analysis is a crucial practice for businesses, whether they are startups or established players in the industry. It involves identifying key competitors and assessing their strategies to unveil their strengths, such as top-selling products, advertising strategies, market dominance, or areas where they excel. Conversely, weaknesses may encompass seasonal sales fluctuations, high shipping costs in specific regions, or gaps in market penetration.

Analyzing competitors in relation to your business, product offerings, customer segments, and market dynamics is an essential step. It serves as a safeguard against costly mistakes when entering new markets or adapting strategies in the ever-evolving business landscape. Your contribution in this regard will be instrumental in shaping the success of VS Group's expansion efforts.

This task requires you to understand the domain beforehand:

* Basic overview of the e-Commerce business model
* Name of the top 3 e-Commerce retailers in the USA
* Who might be some interesting competitors to analyze?

## Project timeline

### Sprint 1

Sprint 1 will involve the creation of a relational database based on the contents of the dataset provided. It is possible to use feature engineering at this stage and create new features based on some of the others, e.g. a "Supplier price" column.

You can use SQLite or the Python SQLite Connector to deal with the dataset while creating and querying the database.

### Sprint 2

Your EDA should be focused on gaining insights into the dataset. This can be done with any combination of Python, SQL and Tableau, or other tools which you have used during the course, though we recommend creating a Tableau dashboard.

At this stage, you should expand your domain knowledge of e-commerce and consider the needs and challenges of the US market. This is purely for formulating KPIs and should not overshadow the technical aspects of the project. ([Here](https://www.statista.com/topics/2443/us-ecommerce/#topicOverview) is a good resource you can use to start.)

### Sprint 3

In sprint 3 you will delve into clustering, an unsupervised machine learning method. We have some extra clustering tasks to explore for anyone who finishes the task too quickly - it's a very interesting area.

The use of time series as part of a predictive analysis is not part of the course content at this time, but we will provide support for any student who wishes to pursue this.

There will be a minor (max 10mins) presentation, detailing any interesting insights from the EDA, presenting your KPIs and dashboard, and your clustering results. You can also showcase your database design and rationale if you wish. **This presentation does not have to cater to a non-technical audience**.

**Completion Time**: 3 weeks

* **Sprint 1** - 4 days
* **Sprint 2** - 8 days
* **Sprint 3** - 3 days
