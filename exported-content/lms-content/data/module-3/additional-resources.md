## Cloud-Based Computing Power

* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com): The free tier is enough to do some training in the background but can't be left for hours as you'll get kicked off. It might be worth it to pay for a month, or for compute units in a pay-as-you-go fashion.
* [Paperspace](https://console.paperspace.com): Paperspace definitely has a higher learning curve but it's more useful than Colab for certain things. For example, if you're doing something computationally intensive, you can choose the exact kind of hardware you want to run your models on.
