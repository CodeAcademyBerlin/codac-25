title: Data Science / Data Engineer

In this module, you will be introduced to some more advanced technologies and concepts, and you will work on your graduation project.

During the first two weeks and a half weeks, you will make a Data Pipeline project. After this, you will choose the topic of your graduation project. You will have 3 weeks to work on it, and you will present your work to the academy on your graduation day.

The graduation project is the most important project of the course. This is where you have the opportunity to apply all the knowledge you have gained in the past 5 months. The topic is completely free and up to you, but before starting your work, you should discuss it with your mentor to define the scope and goals for the best chance at success.

We have broadly outlined 2 possible approaches to a final project. These reflect 2 different positions you can hope to obtain on the job market.

* Take a business / domain that interests you and analyze it.

  Use all the tools / technologies that you want. Use some simple Machine Learning predictions to spice up your analysis.
* Build a data pipeline and show meaningful insights through an interface (you can use Streamlit Cloud and/or Plotly Dash for showing plots in an interactive web-based app, for example).
