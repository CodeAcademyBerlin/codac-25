Data science is one of the fastest-growing and most in-demand fields in the world. As of 2025, this trend shows no signs of slowing down. From analyzing real-world problems to supporting smarter decisions, data professionals play a vital role across industries.

The best part? You don’t need a degree to get started. With curiosity, persistence, and a structured learning path, anyone can break into the field — whether as a Data Analyst, BI Analyst, or Data Engineer.

It’s an interdisciplinary field that helps us make sense of the world around us, transforming raw data into insights that drive progress and innovation.

## 👩‍💻 Module One: Your Foundation as a Data Analyst

In this module, you'll begin building the essential skills for a career as a **Junior Data Analyst**. The focus is hands-on and aligned with what employers actually look for.

Data analysts work across many domains — including marketing, product, and operations — and while job titles may vary, the core process is often the same:

* Collect reliable data
* Clean and structure it
* Analyze trends
* Communicate insights to drive decisions



You’ll learn how to:

* Work with real-world datasets
* Identify and clean messy data
* Explore trends and draw meaningful insights
* Communicate findings through visualizations and reports

Whether you're helping a marketing team understand customer behavior, supporting product development, or improving internal operations, the goal remains the same: use data to answer questions and create value.



## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Use **Tableau** to build clear and interactive data visualizations
* Write **Python** code using **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and basic statistics
* Apply **SQL** to explore and query structured datasets
* Use basic **machine learning** to test hypotheses and make predictions
* Complete two hands-on projects simulating real client work



## 🛠️ Tools and Industry Focus

You'll work with tools that are highly valued in today's job market. According to LinkedIn and other reports, Python and SQL consistently rank among the top skills for data roles — so this course emphasizes both from the start.

You'll also practice working with messy, real-world datasets. In reality, clean, structured data is rare. Many professionals say that data cleaning is the most time-consuming part of their job — which is why we’ve built realistic challenges into the curriculum. Especially in the second half of this module, you’ll tackle hands-on problems that mirror what real data analysts face every day — where you’ll apply what you’ve learned to handle imperfect data with confidence.
