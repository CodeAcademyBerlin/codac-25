â€‹â€‹A **business intelligence (BI) analyst** uses data and analytical techniques to help organizations make better business decisions. The role of a BI analyst is to collect, analyze, and present data in a meaningful and actionable way for decision-makers.

Key responsibilities of a BI analyst can include:

* Gathering and analyzing data from a variety of sources, such as financial systems, customer databases, and market research reports.

* Identifying trends and patterns in the data to provide insights and recommendations to stakeholders.
* Collaborating with other departments and teams to understand their data needs and help them make data-driven decisions.
* Keeping up to date with the latest BI tools and technologies to ensure the organization is making the most of its data.

The role of a BI analyst can vary depending on the size and industry of the organization, but generally, a BI analyst works closely with other teams, such as finance, marketing, and operations, to understand their data needs and help them make better decisions.
