title: 'Data Analysis: Python and Statistics'
---


## Getting Started with Python

Welcome to **Project 1**, which focuses on the core concepts of **Data Visualization, Python, and Statistics**.

This sprint is your launchpad. You’ll begin by exploring different kinds of charts and learning how to create them using **Tableau**, a powerful and widely used visualization tool. From there, you'll dive into the fundamentals of **Python programming** and **statistical thinking**, with practical tasks sprinkled throughout to reinforce your learning.

Throughout the project, mentors will be available to support you, offering guidance as you work through challenges and concepts.



### Building Your Problem-Solving Muscles

One of the most important skills you'll develop is learning **how to Google effectively**. Finding answers quickly online is a skill that directly reflects your growth. The more comfortable you become with the right keywords, the faster you'll troubleshoot, learn, and build.

> _"You can’t improve what you don’t measure."_

Track how long it takes you to solve issues — over time, that number should drop. This is a sign of real progress.



### Working with Mentors

When booking mentor sessions, always include a clear description of the topic you need help with. Often, the act of clearly articulating your problem leads you closer to the solution.

Mentors will typically ask:

* What exactly is the issue?
* What have you already tried?
* Can you share screenshots or logs?

Having this information ready makes sessions more productive — and more rewarding.



### Completion Time: 3 Weeks

Here’s how this project is structured:

* **Sprint 1** — 5 days
* **Sprint 2** — 5 days
* **Sprint 3** — 2 days
* **Sprint 4** — 3 days

Let’s begin building your foundation in data science!
