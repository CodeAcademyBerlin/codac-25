Congratulations on finishing the preliminary Python & Statistics challenges! These are the tools that will be your day-to-day weapons for any kind of analysis - it's time to put them into practice.

Welcome to **Project 2** which focuses on Python, statistics, and how the core concepts of statistics can be applied to Machine Learning. You will work as a "Junior Data Analyst" in the **Analytics & Research** department of **CODE Analytics**.

**BlueBerry Winery**, a start-up wine maker in Portugal, has approached our company to help them build a **Wine Quality Analytics System** to help them **determine the quality of wines based on their composition**.

Like any modern start-up company, BlueBerry Winery is trying to enter the market with a good amount of analytics and thoroughly researched domain knowledge. Many wine companies fail because they do not start with preliminary quality research, neither on the market nor on their product. With the advancement of technology, more and more companies trust data and machine learning to come to decisions, rather than pricey and limited expert recommendation / analysis.

From a sales and marketing perspective, it is of utmost priority to put a proper price tag on a bottle of wine. One of the major factors contributing to 'Customer Satisfaction' is consistency between quality and price of the products.

Many factors contribute to quality. The age of a bottle of wine, for example, plays a significant role as time affects the flavor, as well as reducing the acidity and tannins in a wine. As the acidity and tannins are reduced, the wine becomes rounder and smoother. The analysis should not be restricted to technical specifications, but also include business / domain aspects so that it can help BlueBerry Winery make business decisions.

As an intern, your task will be to prepare the data to be fitted to a Machine Learning algorithm, analyse the data (taking into consideration the business questions), and present your findings.

Some questions you ask:

* Are there any problems with the data (null values, outliers, sufficient amount of data, etc.)?
* Is the chemical composition of red and white wines comparable?
* Does the chemical composition have any impact on the perceived quality of the wine?
* What are your observations?

You will be provided with guidance from your mentors, however, **you will also have to research and self-learn as much as possible**.

**Completion Time**: 3 weeks and 3 days

* **Sprint 1** - 5 days
* **Sprint 2** - 3 days
* **Sprint 3** - 5 days
* **Sprint 4** - 5 days
* **Sprint 5** - optional
