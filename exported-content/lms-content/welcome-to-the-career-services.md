Welcome to the **Career Service** of Code Academy Berlin!

After graduating as a Web-Developer or Data Analyst it is time to think about the next steps to start your journey in your new profession.

To successfully master the job hunt, we will guide you through several workshops and tasks which will help you prepare in the best possible way.\
As you've already gotten to know and apply the agile / SCRUM methodology, we would like to introduce you to a new and widely used problem-solving approach which is called **design thinking**.\
This process can be implemented to create a best possible version of your profile to present to interested recruiters.\
If you think about yourself as a brand and your possible employer as a user, in the next steps, we want to create a perfect match.

Let's explore this step by step. The design thinking approach follows six stages, which we will apply here as well.

**UNDERSTAND** - Get to know the job market in Berlin and start thinking about where you might fit in the best.

**OBSERVE** - What are best practises, which standards do I need to hit when it comes to CV, applications, cover letters etc.

**DEFINE THE POINT OF VIEW** - Build your story, prepare your pitch and put yourself in the recruiters shoes.

**IDEATE** - We will introduce you to several different methods to sharpen your profile (e.g. 16personalities, STAR method.)

**PROTOTYPE** - Create a CV, LinkedIn profile, Github and tailor it to your dream position.

**TEST** - Get feedback from colleagues and in 1-to-1 coaching sessions, practise technical interviews, network and adjust, adjust, adjust!

If you want to deeper understand the ideas of design thinking you can find a very nice description, MOOCs & resources on the side of SAP's own university in Potsdam, the HPI [here](https://hpi.de/en/school-of-design-thinking/design-thinking/resources.html).
