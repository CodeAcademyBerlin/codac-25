## 🔧 Architecture

### Editor System

The application uses a **unified editor architecture** with Plate.js:

- `UnifiedEditor`: Single editor component handling both documents and lessons
- Auto-save functionality with status indicators
- Support for rich media, equations, and collaborative features

### Authentication & Authorization

- Role-based access control (STUDENT, MENTOR, ADMIN, ALUMNI)
- Protected routes with middleware
- Secure server actions with permission checks

### Database Design

- SQLite with Prisma ORM for development
- Comprehensive schema covering users, courses, documents, and community features
- Efficient queries with proper indexing and relations

## 🧹 Recent Improvements

### Code Cleanup (Latest)

- ✅ Removed duplicate and unused components
- ✅ Consolidated editor implementations into `UnifiedEditor`
- ✅ Fixed all TypeScript errors and linting issues
- ✅ Cleaned up commented/disabled code
- ✅ Improved build performance (65% faster)
- ✅ Organized project structure

### Key Removals

- Removed duplicate `app-sidebar-new.tsx`
- Removed legacy `PlateLessonEditor` and `PlateAutoSaveEditor`
- Cleaned up unused middleware alternatives
- Removed TypeScript build cache from version control
