Follow these guidelines for effective AI-assisted coding in this project:

- Reference workspace rules using `@rules` in prompts
- Use `.cursor/rules/` for consistent guidance
- Reference specific rule files as needed (e.g., `@rules/typescript`)
- Use MCP tools for codebase exploration
- Be specific and batch related requests
- Prefer quality, context-rich prompts
- Reference established code patterns

Model selection:

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: complex refactoring/architecture
- GPT-4: general coding
- GPT-3.5: simple/quick tasks
- Local: frequent/simple tasks
