## ðŸ”§ Configuration & Customization

### Required Setup

1. **Repository Settings:**

   - Ensure GitHub Actions are enabled
   - Grant necessary permissions for workflows

2. **Repository Labels:**
   The workflows expect these labels to exist:

   ```
   type: bug, type: feature, type: documentation, type: security, type: dependencies
   area: ui, area: api, area: database, area: editor, area: community
   priority: low, priority: medium, priority: high
   difficulty: beginner, difficulty: intermediate, difficulty: advanced
   good first issue, help wanted, needs-review, stale
   size: small, size: medium, size: large
   ```

3. **Create Labels Script:**
   You can create these labels automatically using the GitHub CLI:

   ```bash
   # Install GitHub CLI and authenticate first

   # Type labels
   gh label create "type: bug" --color "d73a4a" --description "Something isn't working"
   gh label create "type: feature" --color "a2eeef" --description "New feature or request"
   gh label create "type: documentation" --color "0075ca" --description "Improvements or additions to documentation"
   gh label create "type: security" --color "b60205" --description "Security vulnerability or concern"
   gh label create "type: dependencies" --color "0366d6" --description "Dependency updates"
   gh label create "type: question" --color "d876e3" --description "Further information is requested"

   # Area labels
   gh label create "area: ui" --color "fef2c0" --description "User interface components"
   gh label create "area: api" --color "c5def5" --description "API and backend functionality"
   gh label create "area: database" --color "f9d0c4" --description "Database related changes"
   gh label create "area: editor" --color "d4c5f9" --description "Rich text editor functionality"
   gh label create "area: community" --color "c2e0c6" --description "Community features"

   # Priority labels
   gh label create "priority: low" --color "0e8a16" --description "Low priority"
   gh label create "priority: medium" --color "fbca04" --description "Medium priority"
   gh label create "priority: high" --color "d93f0b" --description "High priority"

   # Difficulty labels
   gh label create "difficulty: beginner" --color "7057ff" --description "Good for newcomers"
   gh label create "difficulty: intermediate" --color "a2eeef" --description "Moderate complexity"
   gh label create "difficulty: advanced" --color "d876e3" --description "High complexity"

   # Status labels
   gh label create "good first issue" --color "7057ff" --description "Good for newcomers"
   gh label create "help wanted" --color "008672" --description "Extra attention is needed"
   gh label create "needs-review" --color "fbca04" --description "Needs review from maintainers"

   gh label create "size: large" --color "FF6347" --description "Large changes"
   ```

### Customizing Workflows

#### Reviewer Assignment (`pr-reviewer-assignment.yml`)

Update the `reviewerMap` object with actual GitHub usernames:

```javascript
const reviewerMap = {
  ui: ["your-ui-expert-username"],
  api: ["your-backend-expert-username"],
  database: ["your-database-expert-username"],
  docs: ["your-docs-maintainer-username"],
  tests: ["your-testing-expert-username"],
};
```

#### Repository Owner Check

Several workflows include `if: github.repository_owner == 'codeacademyberlin'`
Update this to match your organization/username:

```yaml
if: github.repository_owner == 'your-org-name'
```

#### Stale Issue Timing

Adjust the timing in `stale-issues.yml`:

```yaml
days-before-stale: 30 # Mark as stale after X days
days-before-close: 7 # Close after X more days
days-before-pr-stale: 21 # PRs become stale faster
days-before-pr-close: 7 # Close PRs after X more days
```

## ðŸ“‹ Issue Templates

The `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory contains structured templates:

- **Bug Report** (`bug_report.yml`): Detailed bug reporting form
- **Feature Request** (`feature_request.yml`): Comprehensive feature suggestion form
- **Question** (`question.yml`): Help and support request form

These templates guide users to provide comprehensive information, making it easier for maintainers and other contributors to help.

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices for Maintainers

### 1. Regular Monitoring

- Check workflow runs weekly for failures
- Review automatically created issues (dependencies, security)
- Respond to new contributor questions promptly

### 2. Label Management

- Keep labels consistent and meaningful
- Train team members on labeling conventions
- Regularly review and clean up unused labels

### 3. Encouraging Contributions

- Regularly mark appropriate issues as "good first issue"
- Respond positively to new contributors
- Provide constructive feedback on PRs

### 4. Workflow Updates

- Keep GitHub Actions versions updated
- Monitor for new helpful actions in the marketplace
- Adjust workflows based on team feedback

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Workflow not triggering:**

- Check if GitHub Actions are enabled in repository settings
- Verify the workflow file syntax is valid YAML
- Ensure the trigger conditions are met

**Permission errors:**

- Check that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` has necessary permissions
- For organization repos, verify Actions permissions

**Label creation failures:**

- Manually create required labels if the script fails
- Check label names match exactly what workflows expect

**Too many notifications:**

- Adjust workflow conditions to reduce noise
- Consider using `continue-on-error: true` for non-critical steps

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues with these workflows:

1. Check the Actions tab in your repository for error details
2. Review the workflow files for configuration issues
3. Consult GitHub Actions documentation
4. Ask questions in GitHub Community discussions

## ðŸ”„ Contributing to Workflows

These workflows are designed to be community-maintained. If you have improvements:

1. Test changes thoroughly in a fork first
2. Document any new configuration requirements
3. Update this README with changes
4. Consider backward compatibility

**Remember:** These workflows are meant to help, not hinder. If they become burdensome, adjust them to fit your community's needs!
